- fixed crash when enabling "Show Date" and disabling "Hide Menu" 
  (thx to Elchi for reporting and Michael Maucher for fixing)
- introducing delayed snapshot, which can be enabled in the plugin-settings:
  When selecting "Screenshot" in the main menu (or pressing the corresponding
  key on your remote), the plugin waits for you to press the Mute-key twice 
  and then takes the screenshot(s). This way, screenshots of arbitrary osd 
  constellations can be taken. Till now this was not possible, because pressing 
  the assigned remote-button for Screenshot causes the osd to be closed.
- screenshots of osd menus are now named like the menu's title, not like the
  current transmission behind

  (reported by Thomas Günther)

2009-03-15: Version 0.0.13

  (patch provided by Tobias Grimm)
